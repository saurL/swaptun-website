          <strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information
          where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or
          the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p
        >If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</p

      <p>
        We may process your information if you have given us specific permission

        purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e.,

      </p>
      <p>
        In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable

        example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent
          cannot be obtained in a timely way

        <li
          >For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li
        >
        <li>
          If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is
          necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim

        <li>
          If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
          compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the
          collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
          breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a
          province
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment,
          business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the
          purposes for which the information was produced
        </li>

        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
        third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X
        logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
        information about you from your social media provider. The profile
        information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
        concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
        list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
        make public on such a social media platform.

        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is

        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will

      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the
        US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United
        Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you
        greater access to and control over your personal information. You may
        review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your
        country, province, or state of residence.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have
        certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include
        the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal
        information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict
        the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data
        portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decisiomaking. In
        certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
        processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by
        contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW
        CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable
        data protection laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully
        processing your personal information, you also have the right to
        complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data
        protection authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data
        Protection and Information Commissioner.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your
        consent to process your personal information, which may be express
        and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the
        right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your
        consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details
        provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"
        below or updating your preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
        processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will
        it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
        reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>
      <p>
        If you would at any time like to review or change the information in
        your account or terminate your account, you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li
          >Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li
        >
      </ul>
      <p>
        Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or
        delete your account and information from our active databases. However,
        we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud,
        troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal
        terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.

    <UContainer>
      <h2 id="section-12">12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser
        DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal
        standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to
        them at this time.
